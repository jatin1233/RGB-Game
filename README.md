# RGB-Game
This is a RGB color game which I created as a mini-project while doing my course from Udemy on Web Development. It is a game in which you 
have to guess the color mentioned in RGB values given at the top of the webpage. This game has 2 difficulty levels which are EASY and HARD.
You would be given 3 colors or 6 colors to choose from, if you have set EASY or HARD as your difficulty respectively.
Selected colors would be removed if they are wrong, until you find the correct option.
There is also a 'NEW COLORS' option which you can select to change the current colors. And it would be changed to 'PLAY AGAIN' if you find
correct answer.
This game is implemented using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT. This game is purely based on Front-End Development.
HOPE YOU ENJOY PLAYING THIS GAME!!!
